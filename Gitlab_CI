what is gitlab runner:

    git lab runner is small program that will run your CI/CD jobs from .gitlab-ci.yml

Why GitLab Runner is needed?
    GitLab alone cannot execute your code. Runner is required to execute tasks defined in:
                    .gitlab-ci.yml
Example job:

build_job:
  script:
    - echo "Building project..."

  The runner downloads this job → runs it → sends results back to GitLab.


How GitLab CI Works (Very Simple)

    1. Developer pushes code to GitLab
    2️. Pipeline triggers
    3️. GitLab sends job to Runner
    4️. Runner runs the script
    5️. Runner returns results back to GitLab

            service status gitlab-runner
